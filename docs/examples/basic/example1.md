## Example 1: Basic Usage

This example shows how to use the core functionality.

### Code

```js
const app = createApp();
app.run(); 

// Expected output:
// App is running
```

1. Import and initialize the app
2. Call `run()` to start the app

The `run()` method handles initialization and execution. By default it will log "App is running" to indicate successful startup.
