# API Reference

## Overview
This is the root documentation for the project's APIs. The APIs expose functionality for interacting with the core application components.  

## Using the API Reference
The APIs are organized into sections based on the major components and modules. Each section provides detailed documentation on the available methods, parameters, return values and examples.

Refer to the [API conventions](api-conventions.md) for guidelines around error handling, authentication/authorization and other cross-cutting patterns.
